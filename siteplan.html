            <h2>Scenarios</h2>
            <p>My site is for those interested in her fashion and those just interested in her brand and style in general. This will answer any questions they have regarding that and about the artist herself.

        <section>
            <h2>Color Scheme</h2>
            <p> The following are all similar to colors she has used in her fashion collections.
            #6e7f66 A swampy dark green symbolizes a great base to her style and will cover the main subjects and headings.
             Will serve as an accent color #1
            #eee4af  A varient of beige or off white which is also prominently featured in her work. Will serve as the background color 
            #3d1a42  A dark purple that is mainly from her denim painted mural collection, serves as a secondary accent</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Typography</h2>
            <p>The font I will be using is Cinzel.
                I made this choice because it reflects the elegance of her brand and fits with her etherial theme with some of her collections. While still being legible enough to use across the page.
